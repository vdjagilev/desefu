    This config file is specifically needed to search for message databases on
    phone. It traverses all possible files (mainly it's SQLite databases)
    and extracts the data

search:
  sqlite_dbs:
    -

      mod: file.Extension
      args: ['', 'sqlite', 'sqlite3', 'db', 'db3']
    -
      title: "SQLite3 databases only"
      mod: file.FileHeader
