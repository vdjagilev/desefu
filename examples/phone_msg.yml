    This config file is specifically needed to search for message databases on
    phone. It traverses all possible files (mainly it's SQLite databases)
    and extracts the data

search:
  sqlite_dbs:
    -
      mod: Extension
      args: ['', 'sqlite', 'sqlite3', 'db']
    -
      mod: FileHeader
      args:
        types: ['sqlite3']
    -
      mod: Dictionary
      args:
        - '/path/to/dictionary_words.txt'
      sub:
        -
          mod: SqliteDatabase
          extract:
            columns: [result, timestamps] # Result columns and tries to get timestamps
            order:
              timestamps: DESC
            result:
              - columns # Also possible to fetch whole table, or some rows where information were found
